            <h4>Central Processing Unit</h4>
            <p>
                A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry that 
                executes instructions comprising a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) 
                operations specified by the instructions in the program. This contrasts with external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry, 
                and specialized processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).

            <h2>Motherboard</h2>
            <h4>MOBO</h4>
            <p>
                A motherboard (also called mainboard, main circuit board, mb, mboard, backplane board, base board, system board, logic board 
                (only in Apple computers) or mobo) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose computers and other expandable systems. 
                It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) 
                and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems, such 
                as the central processor, the chipset's input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and other components integrated for 
                general use.

            <h3>Graphics Processing Unit</h3>
            <p>
                A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation 
                of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, 
                workstations, and game consoles.
                
                Modern GPUs are efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing. Their parallel structure makes them more efficient than 
                general-purpose central processing units (CPUs) for algorithms that process large blocks of data in parallel. In a personal computer, a GPU can be 
                present on a video card or embedded on the motherboard. In some CPUs, they are embedded on the CPU die.
